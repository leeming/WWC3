* Look into making a generic Logger class that handles std/file/firephp type logging

* Better DB management?

* Session handler NEEDS to be added

* Licence block and common doc needs to be added to each file

* Refine error handler (point users to mantis? auto mantis report?)

* INC_PATH vs putting dependencies at top of each file (such as for classes)

* Add support for exceptions in classes to make error handling easier

* Semi Stand alone components needing attention are: Mail, News and Validation based classes  

* Most of the user management is undone

* Order this file into TODO categories, such as for code architecture, user management, missing game classes, library components, etc

* Review if some classes are still used:
